ken thompson, who developed unix along with dennis ritchie in the 70s, built a little text game called _space travel_ while working on the multics operating system for the GE 645 mainframe computer.

after leaving the multics project, he wanted to find a way to run this game more cheaply. he ended up finding an old PDP-7, a more accessible minicomputer, but in order to play _space travel_, had to figure out how to port key elements of the multics OS from the big GE 645 to the old minicomputer, and in doing so, did a lot of the early thinking and design work for what later became unix.

i really love how many of the early os innovations came from developers seeking to build themselves an envrionment that they _enjoyed_ working (or in this case, playing) in. when you listen to linus torvalds talk about the early days of linux and git, the stories start similarlyâ€”motivated by a desire to fix a pretty personal problem (or as linus put it in one talk, a desire to "fill the potholes that he sees right in front of him"), he developed systems that ended up changing the world.

i like to think that this is the spirit i am embodying when i spend too much time customizing my neovim config...
