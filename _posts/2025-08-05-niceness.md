while i was looking at `htop` for something today, i noticed the "NI" column (which i normally do not pay much attention to). it turns out that it stands for the `niceness` of a process, which impacts how much cpu time it gets!

`niceness` values can range from -20 to 19, with a higher value indicating a lower priority process. in addition to being cute, the naming makes this pretty clear: a _nicer_ process will more willingly give up some of its cpu time to other processes : )

`niceness` values allow the user to have some amount of control over the scheduling decisions made about their processes. you can assign a `niceness` value by running `nice -n <number> <command>` to spawn a new process with a given `niceness`, or you can modify existing processes using a command called `renice`. 

taking a look at my `htop`, only a few processes have nonzero `niceness` values. they're all quite nice, though! one process is indexing data on my mac for spotlight (niceness = 17), another is a long-running background process powering "wake on demand" via the network (niceness = 10), and the nicest one is another network-related daemon (niceness = 20).
