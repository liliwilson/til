## what is a top level domain?
a top level domain (TLD) is a domain in the root zone of the DNS hierarchy.

there are a few subtypes of TLDs:
- **generic TLDs** _e.g. .com, .org, .net_: for "general use"
- **sponsored TLDs** _e.g. .gov, .edu, .mil_: registered by organization for specific use case 
- **country code TLDs** _e.g. .us, .de, interestingly both .ml and .ai_: two letter codes for specific countries

these are all managed by ICANN, a nonprofit that holds a lot of internet-related power in its hands (and, if you read its information about how its board is structured and how decisions are made, you can see that this power is not lost on them!)



## so, what else did you learn?
in 2012, ICANN started a program called the "New gTLD Program" aimed at expanding the number of top level domains. 

to get a new gTLD, an organization/business has to submit an application to ICANN, pay a $185,000 application fee, and explain what you want to use the gTLD for. after the 2012 round of this program, we went from 22 gTLDs to over 1000. they also accept applications for gTLDs in a variety of scripts (including arabic, chinese, and cyrillic)

the next application round is likely going to be in 2026!



## do you have favorite TLDs?
great question! you can browse all of the TLDs on [this website](https://www.iana.org/domains/root/db).

personal favorites include:
- `.barefoot`, owned by a winery in california
- `.meme`, owned by Charleston Road Registry Inc., [which is actually google](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Registry) (i find this very amusing)
- `.you` is owned by amazon, which i honestly find a little creepy

a ton of domains (including `.pizza`, `.accountants`, `.plumbing` and `.wtf`) are owned by "Binky Moon LLC", which apparently is actually a company called "Donuts Inc". they're sitting on a ton of gTLDs, and from a _very_ brief google search, i can tell that there is too much there for me to explore today. for now, i will save myself that rabbit hole, but maybe will be back with a future til on Donuts and their hoarding of random gTLDs...
