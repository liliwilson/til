# til
a little cli tool for posting to my own rss feed!

very much a work in progress, and very much janky at the moment.

inspired by [nom](https://github.com/guyfedwards/nom?tab=readme-ov-file) and various TIL blogs that i have really been enjoying lately (in particular, [this one](https://jvns.ca/blog/2024/11/09/new-microblog/) from julia evans!)
